The <header> and <footer> elements are supposed have a background color, but no color appears.
The <h1> in the header and the <p> in the footer are both too high up on the page — this is especially apparent on the <h1>, which is nearly off the screen! You could try clicking on the <h1> in the developer tools inspector and then unchecking the checkboxes next to the CSS declarations shown in the rules panel to find out which one is causing the problem.
The <img> is supposed to be floated down and to the right so it sits to the right of some of the text, but it isn't — it's directly above all of the text.
The text in the <main> content area is far too small — the paragraphs and list items should have a larger font-size applied to it, but it doesn't seem to have been applied to either. Hint: This one is a bit harder, as it is a problem with the selector rather than a property.  You may have to study the source code to find this — you can find it in the Style Editor in Firefox's developer tools.
