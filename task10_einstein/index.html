      <p>“To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast
        oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.”</p>
      <p>Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural
        philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential
        men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
        Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most
        influential book in the history of science.</p>

        <p>“A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.”</p>
        <p>Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of
          relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by
          the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
          Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially
          for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p>

      <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
      <div class="year">1856 – 1943</div>

        <p>“The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One
          must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be
          quite insane.”</p>
        <p>Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described
          as the most important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a
          man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for
          many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and
          magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and
          developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation
          that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible
          spectrum.</p>
        <p>He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first
          theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the
          notion of a Newtonian fluid.</p>
